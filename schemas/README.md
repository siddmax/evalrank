# Schemas

Public EvalRank JSON Schema contracts live here.

- `openapi.json` defines the public REST route contract and references the payload schemas below.

- `evalrank-manifest.schema.json` defines Manifest V1 for the canonical public cell, benchmark-family, feed, governance, cadence, lineage, and eligibility inventory in `catalog/manifest.json`.
- `benchmark-research-provenance.schema.json` defines the closed V1 companion contract for dated primary/official family sources and categorized source-backed or EvalRank-inference claims in `catalog/research-provenance.json`.
- `source-artifact.schema.json` content-addresses replayable upstream bytes and their canonical source coordinates.
- `run-provenance.schema.json` records one closed parser/run envelope with a non-empty role-typed artifact-input set and exactly one `primary`; runtime validators additionally enforce canonical role order and unique artifact IDs.
- `observation.schema.json` defines closed metric and uncertainty unions for one evaluated configuration.
- `configuration-passport.schema.json` pins one resolved manifest identity and reproducible configuration.
- `evaluated-configuration.schema.json` content-addresses a configuration passport.
- `serving-offer.schema.json` separates dated context and availability from effective-dated integer-microusd pricing schedules, including nullable cached-read/storage rates and TTL-qualified cache-write rates.
- `evaluation-to-offer-link.schema.json` records reviewed exact, incompatible, or unresolved configuration-to-offer evidence with an explicit evidence basis; inferred links are never decision-eligible.
- `decision-query.schema.json` defines transport-free semantic decision intent for one exact ranking group and a closed monthly usage profile. Estimated cache usage requires an explicit zero-cache profile; measured usage forbids one.
- `decision-receipt.schema.json` defines a deterministic, typed top-set or abstention receipt, including nullable baseline and zero-cache projected monthly costs on every selection.
- `benchmark-health.schema.json` defines closed per-cell catalog, implementation, admission, publication, and rank-eligibility counts. Runtime projection reports `active` only with a published group, `preview` only with an implemented shadow/active feed, and `unavailable` otherwise.
- `leaderboard.schema.json` defines a cell snapshot set with separate ranking-group publication sections. Its content-addressed descriptor carries a closed, UTF-16-sorted list of exact `ranking_group_id`/`publication_snapshot_id` ownership pairs.
- `entity-detail.schema.json` defines one exact evaluated configuration and ranking projection.
- `compare-result.schema.json` defines a two-to-four configuration comparison on one group scale.
- `capability-fingerprint.schema.json` mirrors `CapabilityFingerprintInput.to_dict()`.
- `raw-entry.schema.json` mirrors `RawEntry.to_dict()`.
- `use-case-catalog.schema.json` mirrors `UseCaseCatalog.to_dict()`.
- `problem.schema.json` pins the RFC 9457 Problem Details error shape and public retry extensions for public route contracts.

Schemas that expose `methodology_version` require `YYYY-MM-DD.SEQ.slug`.

Generated public hashes use 64-character lowercase hex strings.

Observation uncertainty is a closed typed object and decimal measurements remain canonical strings.

Public event timestamp fields use UTC `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` strings; private scheduler cadence and runtime refresh policy stay outside the schemas.

Artifact, evaluated-configuration, semantic-query, and receipt identities use the shared restricted RFC 8785 subset: UTF-16 object-key ordering, UTF-8 without whitespace, safe integers, no floats, valid Unicode, and no normalization. Set-valued query fields reject duplicates and serialize sorted.

Monthly cost is computed from uncached input, cached reads, output, exact-TTL cache writes, and cache-storage token-seconds using integer arithmetic over one common denominator and one final ceiling. A missing rate for any nonzero component is an abstention condition, never a zero-price default. The receipt calls these values projections under declared profiles, requires a hard monthly budget to cover both the baseline and any declared zero-cache profile, and discloses `cost_sensitive_to_usage` whenever estimated projections differ. Cross-field total-input/output equality, duplicate TTL rejection, exact cost recomputation, cross-profile budget comparison, caveat truth, and pricing `effective_at` validity are enforced by the Python and TypeScript semantic validators where JSON Schema cannot express them.

Manifest identity triples are one of five explicit versioned resolved combinations (model, agent, system, component, or arena) or exactly `unresolved`/`unresolved`/`unresolved-v1`; mixed or invented combinations are invalid. Unresolved identities must be explorer-only, and resolved identities may also be explorer-only when the evidence policy cannot support a top set. Every explorer ceiling keeps top-set, winner, superiority, practical-effect, and leave-one-family-out fields null; active groups must use the single-winner-capable policy. Discovery keeps adapter IDs, metric direction, rank counts, cadence thresholds, and task/environment/grader lineage IDs null. Shadow feeds require an adapter and an explicit higher/lower native-metric direction while rank-eligible counts remain null. Active feeds additionally require a positive rank count, approved rights, validated ordered cadence, validated lineage, and a validated correlation group; active ranking groups require calibrated evidence, a positive rank count, and enough independently counted active families for their top-set gate. Quarantine requires an explicit reason and null rank count, while non-quarantined records keep the reason null. A family may expose multiple feeds, but feeds sharing a declared correlation group count once.

`npm run test --prefix packages/sdk-ts` compiles the manifest schema with Ajv's Draft 2020-12 implementation, validates the canonical manifest, and mutation-tests the closed identity, cadence, lineage, correlation, quarantine, and admission branches. `tests/test_catalog_manifest.py` guards cross-record cell, family, feed, ranking-group, and independent-family joins that JSON Schema cannot express.

`tests/test_catalog_research_provenance.py` validates the research companion with Ajv's Draft 2020-12 implementation and guards exact manifest-version/family coverage, dated HTTPS source references, claim-source joins, direct-versus-inference categorization, and exact research-flag linkage. Research sources do not establish runtime lineage, rights, or admission.

Core contract tests also guard public string fields that JSON Schema already constrains; those values must be actual non-empty strings before serialization.

Observation schemas never duplicate mutable source URLs or hashes inside run provenance. They preserve proportion, continuous, pass-at-k, pairwise-preference, and rank-only evidence without coercing unlike metrics onto one scale. Unknown, standard-error, and interval uncertainty remain explicit.

Use case catalog schemas expose public taxonomy metadata: slugs, names, one-line definitions, entity-kind spans, and rank policy. The canonical cell inventory and calibrated-gate policy live in `catalog/manifest.json`; evidence synthesis lives in `methods/evidence-synthesis.md`. Private observations and persistence semantics stay outside this repo.

Problem Details schemas intentionally allow extension members. Public extensions are limited to `code`, `retriable`, `retry_after`, `field`, `request_id`, and `doc_url`; optional `doc_url` values are public HTTP(S) URLs. Private problem types, hosted error internals, auth context, and tenant details stay outside this repo.

The OpenAPI contract contains exactly seven launch paths: taxonomy, grouped leaderboard/entity/compare reads, benchmark health, deterministic decision creation, and explicitly shared receipt retrieval. It reuses response components for malformed requests, unsupported media, validation errors, not-found reads, rate limits, temporary unavailability, and upstream timeouts. `429` responses expose `Retry-After`, `RateLimit`, and `RateLimit-Policy` header contracts; the repo does not implement live throttling.
